# Recognizing human activity using multiple wearable accelerometer sensors
#### Human Activity Recognition, is the problem of predicting what kind of activity a person is performing based on a signals detected by smartphone sensors on their waist.
#### Two types of sensors present in smartphones are:
#### 1. `Accelerometer`
#### 2. `Gyroscope` 
#### Accelerometer measures acceleration and Gyroscope measures angular velocity.

## How the data was prepared?
1. 30 volunteers referred to as subjects  performed the experiment for data collection wearing smartphones sensors on their waist.
2. The two smartphone sensors captured the  **3 axial linear acceleration** as well as the  **3 axial angular velocity** of the subject.
3. The sensor signals were sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of **2.56 sec** and **50% overlap** (128 readings/window).
4. The data were recorded at the constant  frequency of **50Hz**  (50 data points  were recorded each second )
